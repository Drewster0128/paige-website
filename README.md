# Paige Website

## Overview

This project serves as a digital portfolio to my sister, Paige Cook's, artwork.

## Technologies Used
-  Vite for scaffolding
-  React as framework
-  Tailwind for css

## Lessons Learned
-  After working with Vue and React this semester, I prefered using Vue and wished I had used it here
-  TailwindCSS gave me a lot of headaches and made component code difficult to read. I would rather use pure CSS from an external style sheet

## Future Scope
-  Build a backend database
-  Add more artwork Paige has worked on
-  Edit CSS at breakpoints for responsive design
